# Economic Mobility: A visual challenge 

### March 29-31, 2019

Parsons graduate students are invited to a design/data sprint for an intensive, one-weekend collaboration with **[MDRC](https://www.mdrc.org/)** on the **[Grameen America program](https://www.mdrc.org/project/grameen-america-evaluation#overview)**, a microfinance model that provides small loans, financial training, and peer support to groups of low-income women in the United States who are seeking to start or expand their small businesses. It is based on the Grameen Bank model developed in Bangladesh during the mid-1970s by Professor Muhammad Yunus, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 in recognition of this model. The program was adapted to the United States context and opened in 2008 its first branch in the country, in Queens, New York. 

For the past five years, MDRC--a non-profit think tank based in New York City--has been conducting an evaluation of the program to understand the extent to which it impacts different aspects of the borrowers' lives and their families, and the ways in which this happens. This is being done through what is called a randomized controlled trial, after which participants are followed through surveys conducted at different points after they joined the study. [The "Microfinance in the United States: Early Impacts of the Grameen America Program" report](https://www.mdrc.org/sites/default/files/Grameen_Report_final-web.pdf) provides early results of the study. Over the next days, you will receive a few more resources with further details of the program and the evaluation.

### Goals 

The goal of the Economic Mobility Visual Challenge is to help a research team convey early results of the evaluation of the Grameen America program in a visual format that is accessible to a broad audience. The design sprint will provide a space where you can build a community to apply your experience, skills and creativity to produce a visual product that can serve to ignite the conversation about how a micro-lending program might contribute to further economic mobility for low-income women. The best three proposals, which will be selected by a judging panel, will win a cash prize.

### Focus Points

* **Technical Language Challenge:** The report uses concepts that will be understood by researchers. However, the same concepts might not speak to a broader audience. Terms like program and control, statistical significance, impacts, confidence interval, etc. are not terms used in everyday life. How can these concepts be translated visually to allow people not trained in statistics to read the results of this study? What visual language can best convey research findings that allow dialogue across people with different levels of familiarity with formal research training?  
* **Early Findings:** The report presents early findings of the evaluation study. While the findings are promising, the research team wants to be cautious about the messaging of these findings given that the study has not concluded, and later results are still unknown. The challenge is to generate a visual product that sparks enthusiasm, but that leaves the story open ended.  
* 	**Connections to broader field:** While the report presents early results of the evaluation of a specific micro-lending program, it seeks to connect these findings to broader policy discussions in the fields of micro-finance, economic mobility, and poverty reduction. The challenge is to create a product that incites dialogue across a broad set of actors including policy makers concerned with alleviating poverty, practitioners working with low-income women, and researchers interested in micro-finance and economic mobility, for instance.  
* 	**Mixed-Methods Challenge:** MDRC’s microlending program study took a mixed-methods approach, blending quantitative data and qualitative data—the latter in the form of life histories, fieldwork observations, and interviews with program staff.  In the report, these two types of data are presented discretely, even when findings from one source might particularly illuminate or underscore what the other source reveals.  A key challenge in this design sprint will be to conceptualize new visualization approaches that can bridge the gap between the qualitative and quantitative findings, creating a cohesive whole, and clarifying/strengthening the narrative. 

### Some Possible Accepted Deliverable Formats 

* Self-contained HTML page (with a single content folder, if necessary).  Preferably an HTML page with D3 SVG components (for compatibility with the mdrc.org website).  
* A compiled R Markdown file in HTML format.  
* PDF files containing a detailed prototype mockup

### Process

* Once you have read about the microlending program and the early results of the evaluation, you will decide which are the main points that should be highlighted through your digital visualization designs. With advice from your professors and MDRC researchers present at the event, you will figure out the points that you think are most relevant to address the challenge of conveying early results of the evaluation in a visual format that is accessible to a broad audience.  
* To participate you have to create a team of 2 – 5 people with whom you’ll work all weekend. Make sure your team has as many different types and levels of skills as possible so you can complement and learn from each other and potentialize your strengths.  
* Throughout the weekend, you will have a series of meetings and working sessions to understand the challenge, identify the parts that you will work on, to sketch and design data visualization solutions to tell the stories and highlight the issues you choose, and prototype and present your proposals to MDRC and Grameen representatives. At several points during the event, you will be able to receive feedback from participating faculty. 
* Create a prototype and present it to the MDRC and Grameen representatives at the end of the weekend. 

### Resources

Along with other resources and references on the program itself and microfinance, you will receive a copy of a report that the team working on the Grameen America Evaluation recently prepared to present early results from the evaluation, including some key findings from both the qualitative and quantitative analyses. It contains a number of data tables and stories from interviews they have been doing over a longer period of time. The study is still under way, with two more surveys coming up (one at 18 months and another at 36 months after study enrollment), which will be delivered in the next months. 
There’s also a lot of information and studies on microfinance programs around the world - this study is the first one to look at a group-lending model in the US. For a general overview of the field, this article on microfinance may be a useful reference: ["Microcredit was a hugely hyped solution to global poverty. What happened?"](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/15/18182167/microcredit-microfinance-poverty-grameen-bank-yunus). 

You may also want to watch a documentary called "To Catch a Dollar," on Grameen America’s initial operations in its Queens office, the first one it had in the US. Only the trailer is accessible on YouTube but you can find it in New School's library (To catch a dollar: Muhammad Yunus banks on America. Berkeley, CA: Berkeley Media; 2010.) You can also visit the websites of MDRC ([www.mdrc.org](www.mdrc.org)) and Grameen America ([www.grameenamerica.org](www.grameenamerica.org)), and feel free to ask any questions to Toni or Victoria from MDRC, who will be at the venue throughout the event. 

### Criteria for Judging Projects 

The resulting projects will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
  
* How well the projects integrate qualitative and quantitative data;  
* How is the project able to visually convey meaning to a non-research audience;  
* How effectively does the project visually “tell a story”  
* Visual and aesthetic appeal of the product  

The winning designs will have the opportunity to possibly be posted on MDRC’s website. Depending on their format, they might be included in the upcoming report of the project, which is expected to be published in 2020. However, MDRC reserves the right to make this decision.  
The winning team will commit to work after the event with MDRC’s web development staff to get the product up to MDRC’s technical and style standards. This is expected to take between 10-20 hours of your time in the weeks after the sprint.  

Before receiving the report, you will be asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), to ensure that you will make good use of the data that is being shared with you. 
The schedule is set up in a way that ensures you have enough breaks and food to keep you energized throughout the weekend. 
Remember, this is an exercise designed to push your creativity by setting an exciting challenge to tackle over these three days. Make the most of it by focusing on your team!
